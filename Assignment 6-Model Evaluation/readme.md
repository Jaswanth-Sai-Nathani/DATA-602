### Assignment 6

In this assignment we are going to perform model evaluation on pima_indian_data which contains health records of different patients. It contains 768 rows and 9 columns for our evaluation. We are going to create a pipeline for the data to run logistic regression. As we see that there is no null data we just use a standard scalar and create a pipeline for logistic regression. We also will try to assess the data by creating logistic regression for 5 different regularisation strengths and 2 solvers. I used "sag" and "lbfgs" as this not a very big dataset.
