#### Assignment 8 
### Ensemble Techniques

In this notebook we are going to perform ensemble analysis using various machine learning algorithms.
This data consists of 10000 rows and 25 columns. We are going to select multiple features while doing this as per our requirement for processing purposes.
We have used three machine learning algorithms.
1.Logisctic regression 
2.Decision Tree
3.Support Vector Machines

We have used all the three algorithms to understand which performs better in the given scenario. Also we used ensembled using these three algorithms to extract better performance combining all the three.
