## Moving Violations Issued in September 2021
### FINAL PROJECT DATA 602

#### Objective
Traffic violations are one of the major concerns in any part of the world. Understanding this data will help and taking necessary actions will help achieve significant reduction in the number of road accidents in the future. My objective is to understand and estimate the reasons behind the most repeated violations which are causing road accidents and help reduce them.

#### INTRODUCTION
Data used in this project pertains to moving citations issued by law enforcement of various DC agencies and federal partners to violators.
If a vehicle is in motion when the transgression occurs, it is deemed a moving violation. This includes speeding, running a stop sign or red light, reckless driving, drunk driving (DUI/DWI), racing, and eluding an officer. 

#### CONCLUSION
Out of the three models we designed everything seems to perform in a similar manner while logistic regression having minutely better results compared to others. The predicter variable and the dataset is highly imbalanced which led to high accuracy scores for our estimations Through this project I have learned who to do one hot encoding when categorical columns have more number of unique values. Having a better data in hand we could have done so much more like predicting the age groups of frequent violators or finding the time at which most of the violations are happening etc. In future we could expand on these ideas but taking in more data with the help of which we can reduce traffic violations across many parts of the country.
